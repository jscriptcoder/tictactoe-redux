# TicTacToe and Redux architecture

This is my first attempt to implement a redux application, and nothing better than this paper-and-pencil game, TicTacToe, to do so :-P.

The game is written in TypeScript using ES6 Module System, built with Webpack, and has RxJS and Redux as main dependencies.

## Download source
Open a terminal or command line and run following commands:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jscriptcoder/tictactoe-redux.git
$ cd ticktactoe-redux
```
<<<<<<< HEAD

##Installing and running
```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run server
```

Have fun :-)
