# TicTacToe and Redux architecture

This is my first attempt to implement a redux application, and nothing better than this paper-and-pencil game, TicTacToe, to do so :-P.

The game is written in TypeScript using ES6 Module System, built with Webpack, and has RxJS and Redux as main dependencies.

How to run it. Open a terminal or command line and run following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/jscriptcoder/tictactoe-redux.git
cd ticktactoe-redux
npm install
npm run start
```

Have fun :-)
